It was an outcome of a challenge thrown by one prophetess called Dr. Bunni Bentie from Nigeria to all the campers concerning a continuous need of praying for nations across the world. It started with one hundred and fifty people as they were led by the Holy Spirit. This challenge call up was meant to intercede for Africa so that Christianity would take over the continent. This initiative actually led to the spiritual directions of embarking on international missions by Excellent Youth Outreach. Watch tower is also meant to collaborate with the national prayer department of Excellent Youth Outreach to help pray into camps. </p>
